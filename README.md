## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

## Getting Started

<p align="justify">These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</p>

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x to run the following code. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.
In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

### Installation

Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ruudjuffermans/Python-Playground.git
```

2. Setup the virtual environment

```sh
python3 -m venv .env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```sh
source ./.env/bin/activate
```

4. Upgrade pip

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

5. Install the dependencies
