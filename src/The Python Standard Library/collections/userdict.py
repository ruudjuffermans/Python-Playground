Python supports a dictionary like a container called UserDict present in the collections module. 
This class acts as a wrapper class around the dictionary objects. This class is useful when one 
wants to create a dictionary of their own with some modified functionality or with some new 
functionality. It can be considered as a way of adding new behaviors to the dictionary. 
This class takes a dictionary instance as an argument and simulates a dictionary that is kept 
in a regular dictionary. The dictionary is accessible by the data attribute of this class.

# Creating an UserDict
userD = UserDict(d)

# Creating an empty UserDict
userD = UserDict()
print(userD.data)
